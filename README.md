### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Krzysiek (or Chris for the ~99.5% of people that cannot speak polish :grin:)  
I'm adding here all the projects that I create and I think can be useful to people.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various small IoT trinkets using ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico W.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust :crab: - original, huh? :wink:
